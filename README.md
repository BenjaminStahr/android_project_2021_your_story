# Your Journey: An Emotional Diary
"Your Journey" is a university project designed to help users reflect on their emotional well-being by offering a rich, multimedia-based diary experience. Users can document their daily emotional state across multiple dimensions and track their emotional progress over time. This app provides a meaningful way to understand personal emotions, visualize them, and create personalized reports.

## Project Overview
"Your Journey" allows users to record daily emotional states using a Likert scale that covers six emotional dimensions: joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. In addition to these emotional entries, users can add rich media such as text, voice recordings, photos, and location data to capture a comprehensive view of their day.

The app is divided into three main sections, accessible through a bottom navigation menu:
- **Daily Diary (Center)**: Users can log their emotions via a Likert scale and write entries with multimedia like text, voice recordings, photos, and location.
- **Report Section (Left)**: Users can generate and manage reports that visualize emotional patterns over time.
- **Diary Section (Right)**: Users can browse past diary entries, with a daily summary of their emotional state displayed as pie chart.

Below are some screenshots that provide a deeper insight into the app's UI:
